# Putting My Attendance Calculator App to the Test

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project.

We've all been there—trying to figure out if we can miss one more class without falling below that dreaded 75% attendance mark. I built a simple web app to solve that exact problem.

But what good is an app if it's buggy or confusing? That's what this project is all about. I switched hats from being the developer to being the user (and a very picky one at that!) to make sure the calculator was solid.

### My Game Plan: How I Tackled the Testing

I decided to go with **manual testing** because I wanted to really put myself in a user's shoes. I didn't just want to see if it *worked*; I wanted to see how it *felt* to use.

Here’s what I focused on:

* **Does the math actually work? (Functional Testing)**
    I checked all the calculations with different numbers to make sure the results were always accurate.

* **Does it look good and feel easy to use? (UI/UX Testing)**
    I clicked every button, checked the layout on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), and made sure everything felt intuitive.

* **What happens if someone tries to break it? (Validation Testing)**
    This was the fun part. I tried leaving fields blank, typing in letters instead of numbers, and using negative values to see if the app would handle it gracefully (it did!).

### The Full Breakdown: My Test Plan

I didn't just randomly click around. I created a detailed test plan with over 20 specific scenarios. For each one, I documented what I expected to happen and what *actually* happened.

It gives a really clear picture of how thorough the testing was.

### What I Walked Away With

This project was a fantastic learning experience. It really hammered home that building something is only half the battle; making sure it's high-quality is the other half. I got a lot better at anticipating user mistakes and thinking about all the little things that make an app feel polished and trustworthy.
