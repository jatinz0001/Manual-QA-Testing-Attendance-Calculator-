# Testing My Attendance Calculator Project

### About This Project

Hello. I made a small web app to calculate class attendance.

This project is about how I tested that app. I wanted to make sure it works well and has no problems.

### The App I Tested

The app is a simple calculator and it is created by me. Here is what it does:

* You can enter your "classes attended" and "total classes".
* You can also enter your "target percentage".
* It calculates your current attendance percentage.
* It tells you if you have met your target.
* It has a "Calculate" button and a "Reset" button.

### How I Tested the App

I tested the app myself, like a normal user would. I did not use any special software for it.

I checked a few important things:

1.  **Does it work right?**
    * I checked if the math and all the calculations are correct.

2.  **Is it easy to use?**
    * I checked if the app looks good and if the buttons are easy to click.

3.  **What if you enter wrong information?**
    * I tried to use letters instead of numbers. I also tried using negative numbers to see if the app would crash.

4.  **Does it work on different web browsers?**
    * I opened the app on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox to see if it looked the same.

### What I Learned

* I learned that testing is very important to make good software.
* It is helpful to think like a user to find problems.
* Making a plan before testing helps to do a better job.

Thank you for looking at my project.
